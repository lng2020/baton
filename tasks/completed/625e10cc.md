# have a discussion first instead of creating task directly

 instead of creating task direclty, we should have a dicussion with a agent engineer. it should look like an input box with dialog just like all other llm web application, chatgpt etc. after we done dicussion, the agent engineer will come up with a plan with several tasks. then the user hit confirm, those tasks will be performed like normal.
