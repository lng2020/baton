# Add image storage backend and static file serving

type: feature

Create the image upload storage infrastructure:

1. **Create uploads directory structure**: Add `uploads/` directory under the project root, organized by context (e.g., `uploads/chat/`, `uploads/tasks/`).

2. **Add upload endpoint to agent** (`backend/agent.py`):
   - Add `from fastapi import UploadFile, File` to imports
   - Create `POST /agent/upload` endpoint that accepts multipart file uploads
   - Validate file types (allow only images: png, jpg, jpeg, gif, webp)
   - Limit file size (e.g., 10MB)
   - Save files to `uploads/{uuid_filename}.{ext}` preserving extension
   - Return JSON: `{"filename": "...", "url": "/uploads/...", "original_name": "..."}`
   - Mount `uploads/` as a static directory: `app.mount("/uploads", StaticFiles(directory=uploads_dir), name="uploads")`

3. **Add upload proxy to dashboard** (`backend/server.py`):
   - Add `POST /api/projects/{project_id}/upload` endpoint
   - Accept `UploadFile` and forward it to the agent's `/agent/upload` endpoint via the connector
   - Mount a fallback static route if needed for serving uploads

4. **Add upload method to connector layer**:
   - `backend/connectors/base.py`: Add `async def upload_image(self, file_data: bytes, filename: str) -> dict` abstract method
   - `backend/connectors/http.py`: Implement by POSTing multipart to `/agent/upload`
   - `backend/connectors/local.py`: Implement by saving directly to disk

5. **Add `python-multipart` dependency** if not already installed (required by FastAPI for file uploads). Check `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` and add it.
