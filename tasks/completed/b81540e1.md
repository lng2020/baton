# refactor plan mode display

type: refactor

we will remove the plan board. we will have an extra col in the kanban board to show pending plan, if user decide to exe it(should have an play button), then it will bring into different tasks showing on the board. we don't want to track stages of plans. it's just a group of tasks.
