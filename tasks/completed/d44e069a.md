# Skip worktree/commits/tasks re-render when data is unchanged

In `frontend/js/app.js`, the 15-second polling interval (lines 486-492) calls `loadTasks()`, `loadWorktrees()`, and `loadCommits()` every 15 seconds. Each of these functions does a full `innerHTML` replacement even when the data hasn't changed, causing visual disruption (flashing, scroll position reset, hover state loss).

Fix this by caching the previous JSON response and comparing before re-rendering:

1. Add module-level cache variables at the top of the IIFE (around line 4):
   - `let lastWorktreesJson = null;`
   - `let lastCommitsJson = null;`
   - `let lastTasksJson = null;`

2. In `loadWorktrees()` (line 245): After fetching and getting the JSON response, stringify it and compare to `lastWorktreesJson`. If identical, return early without touching the DOM. Otherwise, update `lastWorktreesJson` and proceed with rendering. Reset `lastWorktreesJson = null` in `selectProject()` so a project switch always renders.

3. In `loadCommits()` (line 269): Same pattern — compare stringified response to `lastCommitsJson`, skip render if unchanged. Reset in `selectProject()`.

4. In `loadTasks()` (line 131): Same pattern — compare stringified response to `lastTasksJson`, skip render if unchanged. Reset in `selectProject()`.

This ensures the periodic polling still detects changes, but only re-renders the DOM when data actually changed, eliminating visual disruption from worktree (and other) polling.
