# Add Plans board UI to the dashboard

type: feature

Add a Plans section to the dashboard UI that shows plan cards, similar to the kanban board but for plans:

1. **Add a Plans board section** in `frontend/index.html`, between the chat section and the kanban board (around line 75):
   ```html
   <div class="plans-section" id="plans-section" style="display:none">
     <div class="plans-header">
       <h2>Plans</h2>
     </div>
     <div class="plans-board" id="plans-board">
       <!-- Plan cards rendered by JS -->
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Add plan card rendering** in `frontend/js/app.js`:
   - New function `loadPlans()` — fetches `GET /api/projects/{id}/plans`, renders plan cards
   - Each plan card shows: title, summary (truncated), status badge, task count, created date
   - Status badges use colors: draft=#f39c12, ready=#9b59b6, executing=#3498db, done=#2ecc71, failed=#e74c3c
   - Cards are laid out as a horizontal scrollable row or a simple grid (not a full kanban — plans are fewer)
   - Use the async context capture pattern (capture `selectedProjectId` at start, check after each await)

3. **Add plan detail view** — when clicking a plan card:
   - Show a detail panel (reuse the existing `detail-panel` or create a similar one)
   - Display: full plan content (the task breakdown), status, created/modified dates, linked task IDs
   - For plans in `draft` or `ready` status: show a prominent 'Start' button
   - For `executing` plans: show progress (which tasks are done/in-progress)
   - For `done`/`failed` plans: show the outcome

4. **Add 'Start' button handler** — calls `POST /api/projects/{id}/plans/{plan_id}/start`
   - Shows a loading indicator while the orchestrator runs
   - On success, refreshes both plans and tasks boards

5. **Wire `loadPlans()` into the project selection flow** — call it alongside `loadTasks()`, `loadWorktrees()`, `loadCommits()` when a project is selected.

6. **Add CSS styles** in `frontend/css/style.css`:
   - `.plans-section` — container styling consistent with `.kanban-container`
   - `.plan-card` — card styling similar to `.task-card` but slightly larger to show summary
   - `.plan-status-badge` — colored status indicator
   - `.plan-start-btn` — prominent action button
   - Follow the dark theme: bg #1a1a2e, secondary #16213e, accent #0f3460

7. **Show/hide plans section** — display when a project is selected (same as kanban board), hide when none selected.
